### Background

In this challenge, I am analyzing climate data for Hawaii. There were two major components, the Climate Analysis and Exploration and the Climate App

### Analysis of Precipitation for the Final Year of Data:
his was looking at the precipitation of all statation in the year of data.
Here is a plot of the results

### Histogram Temperature

## Temperature Analysis
Result: t=31.60 p=3.90 tobs_june 74.944118 tobs_decb 71.041529

As we can see in the result, there is not a big difference in average temperature between the months of June and December. On the other hand, we clearly see that the ttest with an extremely low pvalue, shows that the difference is statistically significant.
